# website_02

- Simple page built using HTML,SASS(CSS) and a little bit of JavaScript. Following the tutorial on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-h8L5hgW-w&ab_channel=DesignCourse) by DesignCourse.

## Comments
- I found it quite easy to follow through the steps. And by using SASS, it is easier to understand and write CSS. Compared to website_01, I did that without SASS, so there were many parts I didn't understand but fortunately, it went well and I learned many new things.
